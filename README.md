Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a linear regression model that uses a regularization technique called L2 regularization to reduce overfitting. L2 regularization works by penalizing the model for having large coefficients. This forces the model to learn simpler and more generalizable relationships between the input and output variables.

Ridge Regression is a popular choice for linear regression tasks, as it is often able to outperform ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. OLS regression does not use regularization, and it is therefore more susceptible to overfitting.

To use Ridge Regression, you need to specify the following parameters:

Alpha: This is the regularization parameter. It controls how much the model is penalized for having large coefficients. Higher values of alpha will lead to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.
Fit intercept: This specifies whether the model should fit an intercept term. The default value is True.
To fit a Ridge Regression model, you can use the following steps:

Import the necessary libraries:
Python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
Use code with caution. Learn more
Create a Ridge Regression object:
Python
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0, fit_intercept=True)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Fit the model to the training data:
Python
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Make predictions on the test data:
Python
y_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Evaluate the model's performance:
Python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean squared error:", mse)
Use code with caution. Learn more
Ridge Regression is a powerful tool for linear regression tasks. It can help to improve the performance of your models and reduce overfitting.
